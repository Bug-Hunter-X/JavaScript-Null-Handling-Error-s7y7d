# JavaScript Null Handling
This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to the handling of null values. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, where the function does not properly handle null inputs. This can lead to unexpected results or errors, like `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'add')` if the function was more complex.  The solution is demonstrated in `bugSolution.js`. This improved version explicitly checks for null values and handles them appropriately, preventing unexpected behavior.  The primary lesson is the importance of handling null values to prevent unexpected behavior and errors in Javascript.
